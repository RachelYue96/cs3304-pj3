**Except the functional programming, logic programming is also time-saving!!**
It's my first time literally use logic programming to write a small program. When I first leant it, I found it so confused and really hard to understand with the normal logic I had uisng languages, like C or Java. It took me a while to clear my mind about what kind of logic would i use for the program.
The program I wrote was a network santinizer, which would encluded certain logic to clean up the network posts for user. If we implemented with normal logic in C or Java, we actually knew what will happen, or what should happen when program runs. While prolog is totally different story. We don't know the expected result and hope the program I wrote will find it for me. *It is Cool!* With logic programming, we don't need to maticular every single detail about how to write the program, instead, we just need to know the 'rules' and 'facts' which will be used to generate such intelligent programme. 
After I tried both functional and logical programming, it really laid out the fact that if we want to write a much simpler program, instead of write every single step out in repeated way, know the logic and core behind the problem will make programming lot of fun.
